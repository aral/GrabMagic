Kinetic Space provides a tool which allows everybody to record 
and recognize customized gestures using the Kinect sensor.

The software has already been used by media artists, dancers and alike to 
control third party software such as Max/MSP, Pure Data, VVVV, Resolume, etc. 
via the OSC protocol. The software is written in Processing and based on 
SimpleOpenNI, OpenNI and NITE.
